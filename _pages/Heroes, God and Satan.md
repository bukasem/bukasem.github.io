**Background-** Lee Harvey Oswald is manipulated by the Bat and his "pawns" to shoot Former Major General of the US Army Mr. Edwin Walker. The main motivation behind it is his obsession with becoming America's next "Hero".

**Thought-** God has warned us against having anything but God's pleasure as our motivation behind our deeds. 
You don't need to be specifically evil for Satan to put you to use. You just have to be convenient.
And there is no one more convenient than the one who wants to "change the world" and "free his people" for the sake of anything but God's pleasure.
